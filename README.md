# Data Visualization and prediction with Python and SQL

This project is focused on show and learn ML concepts to predic a virtual precipitation of rain.
The database is available on Kaggle.
The dataset used in this project have some informations about rain in some USA cities.
When i decided to start this project i was focused and just show a plot of the data, but in the progress i learned a lot about ML algorithm's. So i decided to use some of them in this project.

# Used technologies:

- Python:
    Used to clean, organize and upload the data to a database.
- Docker:
    Used to containerize the files and allow the easy share and deploy of the project.
- MySQL:
    DBMS used to manage the database and the process of the DMBS.
- Pandas:
    Used to manipulate the data inside the script.
- Matplotlib:
    Used to plot the data.
- SciKit-Learn:
    Used to train the ML algorithm with the data.
