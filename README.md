# Data Visualization and prediction with Python and SQL

This project is focused on show and learn ML concepts to predic a virtual precipitation of rain.
The database is available on Kaggle.
The dataset used in this project have some informations about rain in some USA cities.
When i decided to start this project i was focused and just show a plot of the data, but in the progress i learned a lot about ML algorithm's. So i decided to use some of them in this project.

# Used technologies:

- Python:
    Used to clean, organize and upload the data to a database.
- Pandas:
    Used to manipulate the data inside the script.
- Matplotlib:
    Used to plot the data.
- SciKit-Learn:
    Used to train the ML algorithm with the data.

# Conclusion:

Unfortunately the data dosn't have correlation between the variables. By this way it's not a efficient way to train a model based on this data.
